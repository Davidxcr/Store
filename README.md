This is a catalog website for a client who just wanted a simple minimal design to connect him with clients and also update his products and services. 
The website uses HTML, CSS and Javascript as it's main languages. I employed typeform to manage client and customer requests to make it easier for him to answer questions.
The Client also insisted on not needing to manage payment on the website, so i didn't need to implement that. The client will also take care of sending tracking details to the user from the details in typeform which took less than 10 minutes to set up.

Feel free to uses this code and customize it how you see fit
