This is a small Catalog website for a store, writtemn in HTMl, CSS and Javascript. I tried to use minimal designs and also make use of spaces and colors based off what the client requested.
This is a sample code of what i built. I used typeform to collect data and send an email to the store owner.
I am currently working on designing and implementing the actual catalog in a pdf file that is easy to download.
